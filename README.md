###South End Community Day Care
Final deliverable for Community Outreach project where we worked with a non-for-profit organization, South End Community Day Care to revamp their much older website as well as add new functionality through Wordpress. The website must be non-developer friendly so that staff could easily manipulate the content. Asana was utilized to track our progress and provide timely deliverables to the client.
